# Pawsome

Pawsome is a social media app for pets!

- Our motivation for building this app was to create a safe place for our pets to share their adventures!

- With this app we want to do away with the normal and boring human profiles. We want to focus on the real stars, the Pawsome pets!

- Whie developing this we learned that over 65% of pet owners post about their pets. We aso found out that one-third of Americans have a social media account for their pets!
